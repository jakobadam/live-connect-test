live-connect-test
========

live-connect-test is a test suite that tests browsers' JavaScript-Java
interaction, known as `LiveConnect
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveConnect>`_.

Test results for most mayor browsers and OSes are available `here
<http://www.cabo.dk/blog/copy_of_jakobs-blog/applets-missing-information-about-liveconnect-and-deployment>`_. The
tests show that applets using LiveConnect must avoid parsing complex
objects back and forth and using call in order to be cross-browser
compatible.

The test itself is available `here
